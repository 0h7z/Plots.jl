- Overhaul to GroupBy mechanic (now offloads to a recipe)
- Replaced much of the argument processing with recipes
- Added series recipes, and began to strip down un-needed backend code.  Some recipes:
	- line, step, sticks, bar, histogram, histogram2d, boxplot, violin, quiver, errorbars, density, ohlc
- Added `@shorthands` and `@userplot` macros for recipe convenience
- Better handling of errorbars and ribbons

	- `@layout` macro
	- AbstractLayout, Subplot, GridLayout, and everything related
	- Added dependency on Measures.jl
	- Computations of axis/guide sizes and precise positioning
- Refactored and compartmentalized default dictionaries for attributes
- Deprecated Gadfly and Immerse backends
- Added `series_annotations` attribute (previously that functionality was merged with `annotations`, which are not series-specific)
- Removed `axis` attribute... currently not supporting twin (right) y axes
- Check for `ENV["PLOTS_USE_ATOM_PLOTPANE"]` and default to false
- Improved backend interface to reduce redundant code.  Template updated.
- Added `html_output_format`, primarily for choosing between png and svg output in IJulia.
- Partial support of Julia v0.5
- Switched testing to dump reference images to JuliaPlots/PlotReferenceImages.jl
- Moved docs-specific code to new JuliaPlots/PlotDocs.jl
- Moved example list from ExamplePlots into Plots.
